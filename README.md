Who are you?
================================================================================
The name's Max Fierke. Read more about me here: http://www.maxfierke.com/about
	
What is this?
================================================================================
Fallarium is an effort to port Damian Yerrick's *Tetanus On Drugs(TM)* to
Allegro 5 and allow it to run on modern computers. TOD is a Tetris-like game
with added visual effects commonly associated with hallucinogens.

Why?!?
================================================================================
I played a lot of *Tetanus on Drugs(TM)* when I was younger, mainly the GBA
port. I recently rediscovered my love for it and want to make it available
to users of modern computers and those without GBA flashcarts. The original
version of the game (non-GBA) was written over 10 years ago for computers
much less powerful. After getting the game to compile with all the new
Allegro 5 features, etc. I want to begin turning it into a more visually
appetizing game.

How do I use it?
================================================================================
You can't yet. It doesn't compile. I'm not done updating the Allegro 4 (and in
some cases Allegro 3) functions and such to Allegro 5. A lot changed between A4
and A5 so there's a lot to do.
    
TODO
================================================================================
- Update A4 functions and constructs to A5.
- Replace A4 GUI with something more modern that works with A5.
- Bring in gameplay elements from LOCKJAW: The Overdose (GBA version of TOD)
- Update graphics, effects, sound, etc.
- Take advantage of modern 3D hardware.

What are the requirements?
================================================================================
Literally any computer running GNU/Linux, Windows, or even Mac OS X that was
made in the last fifteen years. 

For future proofing, though, make sure you've got a graphics card that supports
OpenGL 2.0.

Where/How can I use this?
================================================================================
The program is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.

If for some reason, you have yet to memorize the GPL, take your lawyer out for a
nice lunch and see LICENSE for more details.

How can I help?
================================================================================
1.	Email me at max@maxfierke.com
2.	If you know Allegro well, starting fixing stuff.
3.	Fork it, do a pull request and if I like your changes, I'll merge 'em.
